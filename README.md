# World of Bits

## Game Description

World of Bits is a map-based game that combines elements of 2048 and Pokémon Go. Players explore a real-world map to find and interact with tiles. These tiles can contain tokens with numerical values.

### Core Mechanics

- **Exploration:** Navigate a map representing your physical surroundings.
- **Token Collection:** Find tiles containing tokens and collect them. You can only hold one token at a time.
- **Crafting/Merging:** If you find a tile with a token of the same value as the one you are holding, you can place your token on it. This merges the two tokens, creating a new token with double the value.
- **Goal:** The objective is to successfully merge tokens until you create a token with a value of 64.

### How to Play

1. The game will generate a map based on your location.
2. Randomly generated tiles will appear on the map around you. Some of these tiles will have tokens with a starting value of 1 or 2.
3. Click on a nearby tile with a token to pick it up. The status display will show which token you are holding.
4. Find another tile that has a token of the same value.
5. Click on the matching tile to merge your held token with the one on the tile, doubling its value.
6. You can also place your held token on an empty tile.
7. Continue this process of collecting and merging to reach the goal of creating a token with a value of 8.
8. Once you reach the goal, you win! You can then choose to restart the game or continue playing.
